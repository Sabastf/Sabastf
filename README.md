1. Summary of the DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project was based on a request from a fictional client who needed a system to help manage driving lesson bookings and streamline the scheduling process for students and instructors. The goal was to design a user-friendly, efficient platform where students could sign up for driving courses, schedule lessons, make payments, and receive confirmation and reminders—all in one place.

2. What I Did Well
One thing I did particularly well was creating a clear UML activity diagram that mapped out the complete user flow—from logging in to selecting a package, scheduling a lesson, making a payment, and receiving confirmation. It effectively visualized the process and ensured all main user interactions were accounted for, which made it easier to communicate the design.

3. What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the technical requirements section to be more detailed. For example, I’d specify the expected response times for system actions, more precise error handling rules, and more detailed permission levels for different types of users (students, instructors, admins). This would improve clarity for future development and testing.

4. Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted user needs by focusing on common pain points that learners and instructors experience, like booking conflicts or lack of communication. I implemented features such as lesson availability checks, email confirmations, and categorized support requests to reflect those needs. It’s crucial to prioritize user needs in system design because it ensures the software is not only functional but also practical and user-friendly—leading to better adoption and satisfaction.

5. Approach to Designing Software
When designing software, I start by thoroughly understanding the client’s goals and user expectations. I use techniques like creating use case scenarios, UML diagrams, and user stories to capture and clarify the system requirements. In the future, I plan to incorporate more iterative feedback loops, such as early mockups and user testing, to validate assumptions early and adjust the design accordingly. These strategies help ensure that the final product meets both business objectives and user needs.
